    <div class="indent1">
    Each actor in the game that has any amount of dialog (whether they be player
    characters, monsters, or items) will have a .dlg file associated with them. A
    DLG file basically represents a state machine. Implicit in the workings of the
    dialog system are two concepts which, because of their obvious similarities to
    the analogous concepts in the AI scripts, I will refer to as
    &quot;triggers&quot; and &quot;actions&quot;. A trigger is essentially the same
    as a trigger from AI scripting; i.e. several conditions AND-ed together, each
    condition being a boolean-valued function. The functions which are usable as
    conditions are listed in the trigger.ids file (which is in default.bif under BG,
    and idsfiles.bif under PS: Torment).<br />
    In keeping with the &quot;dialog-as-state-machine&quot; line of thinking, the
    current &quot;state&quot; of the dialog determines which dialog options are
    available to you. In turn, which dialog option you choose helps to determine the
    next state of the dialog. Now, each dialog state can have a trigger associated
    with it; each dialog option can have a trigger associated with it. If the
    trigger associated with a state fails, you are silently passed to the next
    state. If the trigger associated with a dialog option fails, the dialog option
    is not available. The latter requires little explanation, but the former may not
    be entirely clear, so an example will be provided:<br />
    <pre>state 0:
        trigger: NumTimesTalkedTo(0)
        Text: &quot;Hello, sailor!&quot;
    
    state 1:
        trigger: NumTimesTalkedToGT(5)
        Text: &quot;Go away, already!&quot;
    
    state 2:
        Text: &quot;Hail and well met, yada yada yada.&quot;
    </pre>
    Dialog always tries to start at state 0. The first time you enter this
    dialog, the trigger in state 0 is true, so the character responds &quot;Hello,
    sailor!&quot;. If you leave and try to talk to them again, the trigger in state
    0 will be false, and you will be passed silently to state 1; this trigger also
    fails, so you are passed to state 2, and get the associated message. If you talk
    to the person 5 more times, the trigger in state 1 will be true, and they will
    start to respond with the string in that state.<br />
    Now, one last detail. Each dialog option that is offered to the user can have
    several things associated with it. First off, and most obvious, is the text they
    speak. Second, a journal entry (i.e. text to be added to your journal) can be
    associated with a transition. An &quot;action&quot; (i.e. scripted sequence) can
    be associated with a transition, which can be used, for instance, to start a
    store. And a transition has a &quot;DLG&quot; resource associated with it, for
    conversations which involve multiple people. (i.e. You talk to somebody and then
    a 3rd part interrupts you, etc.) That takes care of the preliminary details.
    Now, on to the format.<br />
