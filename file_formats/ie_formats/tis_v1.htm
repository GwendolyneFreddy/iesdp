    <div class="fileHeader">General Description</div>
    <div class="indent1">
      This file format describes a tileset. There are currently two variants available:<br />
      <br />
      <strong>1. Palette-based TIS</strong><br />
      TIS files are generally comprised of a large number of tiles, each of which consists of a palette and a rectangular block of pixels. Each pixel is an index into the associated palette. Each tile has its own palette and a block of pixels. The pixel data is not compressed. TIS files contain only the graphics for an area - the location information is stored in a <a href="wed_v1.3.htm">WED file</a>.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>2. PVRZ-based TIS</strong><br />
      This variant is only supported by <em>Enhanced Edition</em> games. Each tile definition refers to a block of pixels within an associated <a href="pvrz.htm">PVRZ file</a>. As with palette-based TIS this format contains only the graphics for an area - the location information is stored in a <a href="wed_v1.3.htm">WED file</a>.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Engine specific notes:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>PST can only load TIS files when they are stored in a BIFF file.</li>
        <li>Palette-based TIS induces a noticeable performance hit and occasional visual glitches when used in <em>Enhanced Edition</em> games. It is highly recommended to use PVRZ-based TIS instead.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="fileHeader">Detailed Description</div>
    <div class="indent1">
      <strong>Palette-based:</strong> Each tile consists of a 256 colour palette, with each entry being an RGBA value stored in BGRA order (note that the Alpha value is unused), followed by 8-bit pixel values, which are indices into the palette. The pixel values are row by row, from left to right and top to bottom. Index 0 is hardcoded to be the transparent index.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>PVRZ-based:</strong> Each tile consists of a block of pixels that is defined in an associated <a href="pvrz.htm">PVRZ file</a>.<br />
