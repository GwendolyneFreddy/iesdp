    This file format is used to store graphics data that can be directly utilised by the video hardware.<br />
    <br />
    PVRZ files are basically ZLIB-compressed PVR files. The file format is primarily used in conjunction with <a href="bam_v2.htm">BAM V2</a>, <a href="mos_v2.htm">MOS V2</a> and <a href="tis_v1.htm">PVRZ-based TIS</a> resources. Texture compression for the desktop versions of the games is limited to DXT1 (BC1) and DXT5 (BC3). Compression supported by the mobile versions can vary. Width and height of textures are usually a power of 2, up to a maximum of 1024 pixels.<br />
