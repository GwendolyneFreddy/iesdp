    <div class="fileHeader">Applies to:</div>

    <div class="fileHeader">General Description</div>
    <div class="indent1">
    2DA (&quot;2-Dimensional Array&quot;) files contain a two-dimensional array of data. They are used to hold information in tables, often relating to the game rules, e.g. THAC0 progression.<br />
    </div>
    <br />
    
    <div class="fileHeader">Detailed Description</div>
    <div class="indent1">
    2DA files are generally plain text files, unless the first two bytes are 0xff, in which case the file is <a href="encryption.htm">encrypted</a>. Values in 2da files are white space separated, as a result values cannot contain spaces.<br />
    <br />
    2DA files should always contain at least four rows;<br />
    <div class="indent1">
      The first row contains the file signature, &quot;2DA V1.0&quot;, which may be preceeded by white space.<br />
      The second row contains the &quot;default value&quot; for the file.<br />
      The third row contains column headings.<br />
      Subsequent rows consist of row data.<br />
    </div>
    Any cell (i.e. row/column intersection) which does not contain a value is assumed to have the &quot;default value&quot;.<br />
    <br />
    A sample file appears below.<br />
    <br />
    <pre class="file">2DA V1.0
    1234
            NAME    VALUE   WEIGHT
    A       alpha
    B
    C       beta    2345    123
    </pre>
    <br />
    In this example, row A has the values <code>{ alpha, 1234, 1234 }</code>. Row B has the values <code>{ 1234, 1234, 1234 }</code>. Row C has the values <code>{beta, 2345, 123 }</code>.<br />
