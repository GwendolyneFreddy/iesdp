    <div class="title_main"> Override Folders</div>

    <br />
    Several folders in the main game directory can be used as override folders. The following folders have this function, and are prioritised in the listed order:<br />
    <ol>
      <li>Characters (overrides all others)</li>
      <li>Portrait</li>
      <li>Sounds</li>
      <li>Scripts</li>
      <li>Override (overridden by all others)</li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <hr />
    <br />
    Enhanced Edition games support additional override folders located in the language or user profile directory:<br />
    <ol>
      <li>home:/movies (overrides all others)</li>
      <li>home:/characters</li>
      <li>home:/portraits</li>
      <li>home:/sounds</li>
      <li>home:/scripts</li>
      <li>home:/override</li>
      <li>install:/lang/xx_YY/movies</li>
      <li>install:/movies</li>
      <li>install:/characters</li>
      <li>install:/portraits</li>
      <li>install:/lang/xx_YY/sounds</li>
      <li>install:/sounds</li>
      <li>install:/scripts</li>
      <li>install:/override (overridden by all others)</li>
    </ol>
    Where <span class="mono">install:</span> indicates the installation folder and <span class="mono">home:</span> the user profile folder of the game. The lang folder used by the game is dictated by the current language.<br />
    <br />
    Notes:<br />
    The game's profile folder name is defined by the entry "engine_name" in the file <span class="mono">engine.lua</span>, which can be found in the game's installation folder. It defaults to "Infinity Engine - Enhanced Edition" if the folder name has not been defined. Crash dump files will always be placed into that folder.
