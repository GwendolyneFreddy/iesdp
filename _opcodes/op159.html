Applies the mirror image effect to the targeted creature(s), creating a number of images equal to the <code>Amount</code> value. Sets <a href="../files/ids/bgee/state.htm#BIT30">STATE_MIRRORIMAGE</a> to true.

{% capture note %}
<ul>
	<li><a href="../files/ids/bgee/state.htm#BIT30">STATE_MIRRORIMAGE</a> will maintain the effects of this opcode, once this opcode expires, but only until you save &amp; reload.</li>
	<li>If you set <a href="../files/ids/bgee/state.htm#BIT30">STATE_MIRRORIMAGE</a> on a <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/cre_v1.htm">CRE</a> file, it won't do anything by itself.</li>
	<li>If you later apply <a href="#op119">opcode #119</a>/<a href="#op159">opcode #159</a> to the creature, once it expires, any remaining images will last until struck (absorbing attacks in the process), or until you save &amp; reload.</li>
</ul>
