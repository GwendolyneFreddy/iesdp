<br/>This effect ignores durations attributed to it.

<ul>
	<li>The only difference between this opcode and <a href="#op47">opcode #47</a> is their index â€“ you can block one with <a href="#op101">opcode #101</a> without blocking the other. That's it.</li>
	<li>Both remove the same effects/<code>STATE</code>s, both are blocked by <a href="#op69">opcode #69</a>.</li>
	<li>They might have been intended for identical function, different uses, similar to opcodes <a href="#op5">#5</a>/<a href="#op241">#241</a> (Charm), but it never happened.</li>
	<li><a href="#op116">Opcode #116</a> is used extensively because the original BG1 used it, and didn't use <a href="#op47">opcode #47</a> at all.</li>
