The creature type specified by the <code>Type</code> field becomes immune to the spell or item specified in the <code>Resource</code> field. See <a href="#op324">opcode #324</a> for more information.

{% capture note %}
This opcode can block <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v2.htm">EFF</a> files too.<br/>
In order to do so, both the <code>Resource</code> field of op#318 and the <code>Parent resource</code> field (located at offset 0x94) of the EFF file must be the same string (max. 8 character long). Unlike <a href="#op206">opcode #206</a>, this one can innately block any type of resource (None/Spell/Item).
