	<li>While this opcode is "Non-Cumulative" (it sets values rather than increment), what it really does is stack in reverse standard order.</li>
	<li>The base <a href="../files/ids/bgee/state.htm#BIT25">STATE</a> set on the <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/cre_v1.htm">CRE</a> file will override any effect applied to them (defaulting to a value of zero).</li>
	<li>The oldest equipped effect will override newer equipped effects, and any equipped effect will override a non-equipped effect.</li>
	<li>The oldest non-equipped effect will override newer non-equipped effects.</li>
