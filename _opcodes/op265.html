Alters the global variable specified by the <code>resource</code> key, in the style specified by the <code>Type</code> field, by the value specified by the <code>Value</code> field.
<br/>Known values for <code>Type</code> are:
<ul>
	<li>0 &longrightarrow; Set Global (to <code>Value</code>)</li>
	<li>1 &longrightarrow; Increment Global (by <code>Value</code>)</li>
</ul>

{% capture note %}
Since the <code>Resource</code> Key can only be 8 characters long maximum, you can not set a Global Variable with this effect that has a name longer than this amount.<br />
You can use the VVC field of external EFF files for an additional 8 characters of variable name.<br />
You can use the 3rd resource field of EFF files for an additional 8 characters.

{% capture note %}
<code>Value</code> can store integers or coordinates. Coordinates are stored as first 2 bytes X, last 2 bytes Y (f.i.: <code>310 + (30 << 16)</code>).

Make sure to set target. Target: Self (1) works well. If target is unset (0), the game will freeze.
