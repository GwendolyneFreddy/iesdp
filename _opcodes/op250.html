Applies the <code>Damage Modifier</code> value to the damage caused by the targetted creature(s). The effect works as a minimum damage value, i.e. at least <code>Damage Modifier</code> damage will always be caused (on a successful hit).

<br/><br/>The effect modifies <a href="../files/ids/bgee/stats.htm#145">DAMAGELUCK</a>.

{% capture note %}
This opcode works in the same manner as <a href="#op22">luck</a> (and stacks with it), except that it only affects base weapon damage. It can be positive or negative.
