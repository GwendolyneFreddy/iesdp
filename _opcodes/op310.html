The targeted creature(s) becomes immune to time-stop.
<br/><br/>The effect modifies <a href="../files/ids/bgee/stats.htm#197">IMMUNE_TO_TIME_STOP</a> to <code>Stat Value</code>.

{% capture note %}
The <code>Stat Value</code> parameter can take any value.<br/>
If you set it to <code>0</code>, you will disable the effect (for its duration). For instance, a Time Stop spell that applies (to everyone) op#310 with <code>Stat Value = 0</code> for <code>18s</code> would trap those such as Demogorgon in the time stop.
{% endcapture %}

{% capture note %}
Creatures are naturally immune to their own Time Stop effects, without needing this effect or setting <a href="../files/ids/bgee/stats.htm#197">IMMUNE_TO_TIME_STOP</a>.
