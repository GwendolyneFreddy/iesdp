Applies the wing buffet effect centred on the casting creature(s), buffeting the targeted creature(s) at the speed specified by the <code>Speed</code> field, in the direction specified by the <code>Direction</code> field. <code>Speed</code> ranges from <code>0</code> to <code>255</code>.
<br/>Known values for <code>Direction</code> are:
<ul>
	<li>0/1 &longrightarrow; Away from the destination point (specified in EFF file)</li>
	<li>2 &longrightarrow; Away from the source</li>
	<li>3 &longrightarrow; Towards the destination point (specified in EFF file)</li>
	<li>4 &longrightarrow; Towards source</li>
</ul>

{% capture note %}
If used on creatures with the "pass-wall" effect applied, creatures can cross points marked as light obstacles on the search map.<br/>
In EEs, this effect can push creatures through closed (and locked) doors (this does not require the "pass-wall" effect).

<code>Direction</code> options <code>1</code> and <code>3</code> "can" be overriden in external <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v2.htm">EFF</a> files, but default to the ability target/location.
