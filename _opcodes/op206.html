Gives the targeted creature(s) immunity from the spell specified in the <code>resource</code> key. The strref specified by the <code>String Reference</code> field is displayed when the spell is absorbed.

{% capture note %}
At least in EEs, this opcode can block <a href="../file_formats/ie_formats/eff_v2.htm">EFF</a> files too.<br/>
In order to do so, both the <code>Resource</code> field of op#206 and the <code>Parent resource</code> field (located at offset 0x94) of the EFF file must be the same string (max. 8 character long); moreover, you must set the <code>Resource type</code> field (located at offset 0x90) of the EFF file to <code>1</code> (Spell).
