Applies the time stop effect. 
<br/>The timestop effect lasts half as long as the Duration specified for the effect.
<br/><br/>

In particular:
<ul>
	<li>All creatures not immune to Time Stop will be rendered uncontrollable, can be hit automatically by attacks as if they were HELPLESS (but do not actually have STATE_HELPLESS set), and their frequency-based effects will not trigger (poison/regeneration), but their duration will run.</li>
	<li>Projectiles are suspended mid-flight until the Time Stop ends, at which point they will resume normal function.</li>
	<li>Area effect projectiles are suppressed until the Time Stop ends, at which point they will resume normal function, though their duration will run during the Time Stop.</li>
	<li>Projectiles that hit "instantly" (#0 and #1 for spells/items) are unaffected by Time Stop, which includes all melee weapons.</li>
</ul>

{% capture note %}
Both parameters should be 0 (zero).

{% capture note %}
Only one creature may have a Time Stop effect running at a time, applying a Time Stop effect during another will override the previous. The caster is always immune to their own Time Stop effect, they do not require <a href="#op310">opcode #310</a>, unless their own Time Stop is at risk of being overridden.
