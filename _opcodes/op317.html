This effect is functionally identical to <a href="#op16">opcode #16</a>. The only difference between the two is that some ITMs/SPLs/abilities will specifically block/remove <a href="#op16">opcode #16</a> but not <a href="#op317">opcode #317</a> (e.g., Monks are immune to <a href="#op16">opcode #16</a> but not <a href="#op317">opcode #317</a>).
