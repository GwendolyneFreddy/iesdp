Removes a single instance (or stack) of the item specified by the <code>resource</code> key from the targeted creature(s). Items in container items (e.g. Bags of Holding) will not be removed. If a creature has multiple instances of the item, the one in the lowest slot number (see <a href="../files/ids/bgee/slots.htm">SLOTS.IDS</a>) is removed. <code>EFF_M02</code> is hard-coded to play when an item is removed. This effect should be used to remove equipped items (use <a href="#op123">opcode #123</a> for inventory items).
