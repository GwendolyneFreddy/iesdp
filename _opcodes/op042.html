Alters the number of wizard spell slots available to the targeted creature(s), as specified by the <code>Slot Amount Modifier</code> field, at the level specified by the <code>Spell Level</code> field. Wizard spells are used by Bards, Sorcerers and Wizards in IWD2.
<br/>Known values for <code>Spell Level</code> are:
<ul>
	<li>0 &longrightarrow; Double spells</li>
	<li>1 &longrightarrow; Level 1</li>
	<li>2 &longrightarrow; Level 2</li>
	<li>4 &longrightarrow; Level 3</li>
	<li>8 &longrightarrow; Level 4</li>
	<li>16 &longrightarrow; Level 5</li>
	<li>32 &longrightarrow; Level 6</li>
	<li>64 &longrightarrow; Level 7</li>
	<li>128 &longrightarrow; Level 8</li>
	<li>255 &longrightarrow; Level 9</li>
</ul>

<br/>For a <code>Spell Level</code> of <code>0</code>, the amount of spell slots is doubled for the level specified by the <code>Slot Amount Modifier</code> value and all levels below. The target creature(s) must have at least 1 slot at the selected level to have their slot count changed.
<br/><br/>

Negative slots start at <code>65535 (-1)</code>, and go from there. Even though the spellbook has room to display only 12 slots at once, the slots are still there and usable.

<br/><br/><code>Slot Amount Modifier</code> can be positive or negative.

{% capture note %}
<ul>
	<li>
		If the number of current spell slots is 1:
		<ul>
			<li>applying a <code>-1</code> modifier will result in zero current slots and prevent further applications of this opcode from altering spell slots (until this effect terminates or is removed, or the base amount changes).</li>
			<li>applying a <code>-2</code> modifier instead would bypass zero and result in <code>65535 (-1)</code>. Then applying a <code>+1</code> modifier would result in zero current slots and a repeat of the above.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Regardless of whether the value can be altered, the effect is still attached to the creature, rather than being discarded entirely. They can still take effect should the creature's base spell slots be altered (such as from leveling up).</li>
	<li>Applying multiple effects in increments of <code>-1</code> will insure that spell slots do not go below zero (and thus will not wrap around to maximum).</li>
</ul>
