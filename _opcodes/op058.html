Dispels magic from the targeted creature(s) (excepting magical weapons eg. Spirtual Hammer). Depending on the value of the 'Type' field, the 'Level' field can be used to set the level of the effect.
<br/>Known values for 'Type' are:
<ul>
	<li>0 &longrightarrow; Always dispel</li>
	<li>1 &longrightarrow; Use Caster Level</li>
	<li>2 &longrightarrow; Use 'Level' field</li>
</ul>
<br/>With 'Type' of 1 or 2, the base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. This chance is modified by the relative levels of the dispeller to the caster. Each level below gives a -10% chance, each level above gives a +5% chance. There is always a 1% chance of success or failure.
