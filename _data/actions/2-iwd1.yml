  This action is used to set waypoints for a creature to move between; it is commonly used from area scripts to script barmaids moving in a route around the bar. The point parameter represents the X and Y coordinates of the waypoint to add.

  ```
  IF
    Global("KRNEWWAY","GLOBAL",0)
  THEN
    RESPONSE #100
      SetGlobal("KRNEWWAY","GLOBAL",1)
      AddWayPoint([100.200])
      AddWayPoint([200.300])
  END
  ```

  The following script, showing how to move to waypoints preset in the area file, is taken from the barmaid at the Copper Coronet.

  ```
  IF
    Detect([PC])
    Allegiance(Myself,NEUTRAL)
    Global("quest1","LOCALS",0)
  THEN
    RESPONSE #100
      MoveToObject("Way3")
      ActionOverride("DRUNK2",DisplayStringHead(Myself,4592)
      Wait(1)
      DisplayStringHead(Myself,4604)
      Wait(2)
      MoveToObject("Way4")
      Wait(1)
      MoveToObject("Way3")
      DisplayStringHead(Myself,4611)
      Wait(2)
      SetGlobal("quest1","LOCALS",1)
  END
  ```
