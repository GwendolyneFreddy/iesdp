  This action instructs the active creature to initiate dialog with the target object, using its currently assigned dialog file. This action can be used from a distance and will work whether the target creature is in sight or not. Dialog will not be initiated if the creature using this action has been assigned a dialog that has all top level conditions returning false. If the target is invalid, the active creature will initiate dialog with Player1.
