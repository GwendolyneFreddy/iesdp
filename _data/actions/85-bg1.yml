  This action causes the active creature to walk randomly. The example script is blbear.bcs; it instructs bears to walk rather than fight if the nearest enemy is a druid.

  ```
  IF
    Delay(5)
    See(NearestEnemyOf(Myself))
    Class(NearestEnemyOf(Myself),DRUID)
    NumCreatureGT([ENEMY],1)
  THEN
    RESPONSE #100
      RandomWalk()
  END
  ```
