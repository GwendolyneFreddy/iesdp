desc: |-
  This action causes the active creature to become the players ally. The active creature does not act as a normal familiar (i.e. no HP bonus or Constitution loss on death).
  {% capture note %} Unfortunately, this action is currently bugged (as of v2.5) - It temporarily sets all non-EA values to 0 (GENERAL, RACE, CLASS, ALIGNMENT, SPECIFICS). Anything that forces the targeted character's action bar to update itself will revert the creature to its normal values (and action bar). For instance:
  * Casting a spell from a quick spell slot (needs to update the quantity)
  * Changing the spell in a quick spell slot
  * Using a quick item with quantity/charges
