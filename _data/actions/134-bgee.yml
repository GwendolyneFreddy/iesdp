  This action instructs the active creature to attack the target for the specified time (ReevaluationPeriod) which is measured in AI updates (which default to 15 per second).The script will then run again, checking for other true conditions.
  Just to give an idea, [AttackOneRound()](#105) would be equivalent to AttackReevaluate() with a 100 tick reevaluation period.

    See([EVILCUTOFF])

    !InParty(LastSeenBy())
    !Allegiance(LastSeenBy(Myself),GOODCUTOFF)
    !Class(LastSeenBy(Myself),INNOCENT)
    InWeaponRange(LastSeenBy())
    HasWeaponEquiped()
  THEN
    RESPONSE #100
      AttackReevaluate(LastSeenBy(),30)
  END
  ```
  {% capture note %} Conventional object targets (e.g., 'NearestEnemyOf(Myself)') are "locked in" until:
  * They die / get removed from the game
  * The creature has been chasing target for the time specified by the 'ReevaluationPeriod' parameter

  On the other hand, object selectors (e.g., 'FifthNearest([EVILCUTOFF.PLANT])', '[PC]', 'SecondNearest([0.0.0.IMP])' and so forth) constantly reevaluate the target, not being affected by the 'ReevaluationPeriod' at all. {% endcapture %} {% include info.html %} {% capture note %} The only natural end condition for the action is if it can't find any valid objects to attack, either initially, or after a reeval has been triggered. This means that the script trigger [ActionListEmpty()](../triggers/bgeetriggers.htm#0x402B) will not return TRUE once 'ReevaluationPeriod' is up. {% endcapture %} {% include note.html %}
