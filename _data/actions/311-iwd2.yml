  Adds a Wait action to the queue for the current object, equal to the exact casting time of the spell, i.e. the script writing need not worry about time spent inactive due to failed/cancelled spells. If the parameter is 0 a Wait action equal to the casting time of the previous cast spell is added to the queue.
