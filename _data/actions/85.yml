desc: |-
  This action causes the active creature to walk randomly, staying within the current area. The example script is blbear.bcs; it instructs bears to walk rather than fight if the nearest enemy is a druid.

  ```
  IF
    Delay(5)
    See(NearestEnemyOf(Myself))
    Class(NearestEnemyOf(Myself),DRUID)
    NumCreatureGT([ENEMY],1)
  THEN
    RESPONSE #100
      RandomWalk()
  END
  ```
  {% capture note %}
  * This action will never stop, (unless interrupted in specific situations), and thus never leave the action list.
  * Executes [Wait()](#63) for a random amount of time, (1â€“40 seconds), if the creature goes off-screen.
  * Has a 50/50 chance to [MoveToPoint()](#23), or do a pass of [RandomTurn()](#130), (including [RandomTurn()](#130)'s wait time).
