  This action will remove a number of instances (specified by the Num parameter) of the specified item from the party. The items will be removed from players in order, for example; Player1 has 3 instances of "MYITEM" in their inventory, Player2 has 2 instance of "MYITEM," and Player3 has 1 instance. If the action TakePartyItemNum("MYITEM", 4) is run, all 3 instances of "MYITEM" will be taken from Player1, and 1 instance will be taken from Player2. This leaves Player2 and Player3 each with one instance of "MYITEM." If the last item of an item type stored in a container STO file is removed by this action, the amount becomes zero. Items with zero quantities cannot be seen in-game, cannot be removed by TakePartyItem, and will not count toward a container's current item load. If the item to be taken is in a stack, and the stack is in a quickslot, the item will be removed, and the remaining stack will be placed in the inventory. If the inventory is full, the stack item will be dropped on the ground.
