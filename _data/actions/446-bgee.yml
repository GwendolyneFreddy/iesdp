  This action alters the second variable by the amount indicated by 'Val' only if the first variable evaluates to 0. The amount can be positive or negative. After a successful call the first variable is set to 1. The second action variant combines variable scope and name into a single string. Scope is followed directly by the variable name, e.g. "GLOBALvar1" or "MYAREAvar2". Variables in the local scope can only be changed with this action if they already exist.
