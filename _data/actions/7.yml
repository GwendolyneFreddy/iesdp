  This action is used to create a creature - either an NPC, a neutral creature or an enemy. NewObject is the filename of the creature to create, Location is the coordinates to create the creature at ([x.y] format) and direction being the direction the creature is facing (0-15, 0 being south and the facing values increasing as the character turns clockwise). Note that a coordinate of [-1.-1] will create the creature next to the active creature.

  This script is from the area script for the Copper Coronet (AR0406) and creates extra guards when the Player is discovered in the off limits area.
