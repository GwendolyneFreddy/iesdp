  This action instructs the active creature to move to the specified point and marks the creature as a leader. The following example script sets Player1 walking to [3363.2954] and sets Player2 and Player3 to "follow" to [3363.2954] in a line and with minimal walking into each other. This action is not fully understood, and is not particularly reliable.

  ```
  IF
    HotKey(E)
  THEN
    RESPONSE #100
      ActionOverride(Player1,Leader([3363.2954]))
      ActionOverride(Player2,Follow([3363.2954]))
      ActionOverride(Player3,Follow([3363.2954]))
  END
  ```
