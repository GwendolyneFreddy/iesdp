  This action can be used to control another creature. A creature referenced as the result of [SetTokenObject()](../actions/bgeeactions.htm#248) is not a valid target for the ActionOverride() action. The following is from the Irenicus cutscene after leaving his abode in chapter 1.

  ```
  IF
    True()
  THEN
    RESPONSE #100
      CutSceneId(Player1)
      Wait(1)
      FadeToColor([20.0],0)
      Wait(2)
      JumpToPoint([869.340])
      MoveViewPoint([909.346],INSTANT)
      ActionOverride(Player2,JumpToPoint([825.370]))
      ActionOverride(Player3,JumpToPoint([886.384]))
      ActionOverride(Player4,JumpToPoint([952.386]))
      ActionOverride(Player5,JumpToPoint([987.362]))
      ActionOverride(Player6,JumpToPoint([1005.404]))
      Face(10)
      ActionOverride(Player2,Face(10))
      ActionOverride(Player3,Face(10))
      ActionOverride(Player4,Face(8))

      ActionOverride(Player6,Face(6))
      ActionOverride("Anomen",JumpToPoint([909.346]))
      ActionOverride("Anomen",Face(10))
      Wait(1)
      FadeFromColor([20.0],0)
      Wait(2)
      ActionOverride("Anomen",StartDialogueNoSet(Player1))
  END
