  This action changes the active creature's selection circle to purple and makes it unselectable. If engine\_mode = 0 (default setting for BG1:EE) in engine.lua, the creature continues processing scripts while unselectable. If engine\_mode = 1 (default setting for BG2:EE), the creature stops processing scripts while unselectable. For both BG1:EE and BG2:EE, you can use [opcode 365](../../opcodes/bgee.htm#op365) to make creatures unselectable without disabling their script processing.
