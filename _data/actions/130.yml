  This action causes the active creature to turn in a random direction. The example script is from waitturn.bcs.

  ```
  IF
    True()
  THEN
    RESPONSE #100
      RandomTurn()
  END
  ```

  {% capture note %}
  * This action will never stop, (unless interrupted in specific situations), and thus never leave the action list.
  * Executes [Wait()](#63) for a random amount of time, (1–40 seconds), if the creature goes off-screen.
  * Waits 1–10 seconds between each evaluation.

  {% endcapture %} {% include note.html %}
