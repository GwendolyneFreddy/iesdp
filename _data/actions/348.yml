  This action instructs the engine to use the specified column of [WISH.2DA]({{ 2da }}/wish.htm), randomly select 5 choices (rows; count appears hardcoded) and set the appropriate globals for those spells. Once the maximum "wish choices" have been selected, the dialog continues and casts the selected spell.

  From a dialog:
  ```
  IF ~CheckStatGT(LastTalkedToBy,17,WIS)~ THEN DO ~SetupWish(4,1)~ GOTO 8
  IF ~Global("WishPower01","GLOBAL",1)~ THEN REPLY #72526 /* ~'Breach' on everyone in the area, including the party.~ */
    DO ~ActionOverride(LastTalkedToBy,ForceSpellRES("spwish26",Myself)) ApplySpell(Myself,POOF_GONE)~ EXIT
  ```

  The key is the `Global("WishPower**","GLOBAL",1)`. The highest is "WishPower37", and the highest number in the WISH.2DA is also 37. There are a total of 46 SPWISH\*\*.SPL files, but 9 are unused:

  * SPWISH01 STR Bonus +1
  * SPWISH02 INT Bonus +1
  * SPWISH03 DEX Bonus +1
  * SPWISH04 CON Bonus +1
  * SPWISH05 WIS Bonus +1
  * SPWISH06 CHA Bonus +1
  * SPWISH07 Restoration
  * SPWISH09 Globe of Blades
  * SPWISH15 Gain 10,000 Gold (Party)

  Looking at the spells that have a "WishPower\*\*" next to them, this list can be derived (sorted by Wisdom level (E=enemies, P=party, C=caster A=All)):
