  This action gives a level dependent amount of XP to the party or a single party member. The XP amount is listed in [XPLIST.2DA]({{ 2da }}/xplist.htm) at the intersection of the party level (column) and quest row (the mis-named parameter). The file lists the same XP value for all quests for all levels.
