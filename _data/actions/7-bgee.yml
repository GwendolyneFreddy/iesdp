  This action is used to create a [creature](../../file_formats/ie_formats/cre_v1.htm) - either an NPC, a neutral creature or an enemy. NewObject is the filename of the creature to create, Location is the coordinates to create the creature at ([x.y] format) and [direction]({{ ids }}/dir.htm) being the direction the creature is facing (0-15, 0 being south and the facing values increasing as the character turns clockwise). Note that a coordinate of [-1.-1] will create the creature next to the active creature. Effect of the second action variant can point to a [VVC](../../file_formats/ie_formats/vvc_v1.htm) or [BAM](../../file_formats/ie_formats/bam_v2.htm) resource.

  This script is from the area script for the Copper Coronet (AR0406) and creates extra guards when the Player is discovered in the off limits area.
