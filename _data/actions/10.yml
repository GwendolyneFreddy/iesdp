  This action is used to change the allegiance of the active creature to enemy (making them hostile to the PC). This example script, from a peasant, will turn the creature hostile if it is attacked.

  ```
  IF
    AttackedBy([GOODCUTOFF],Myself)
    Allegiance(Myself,NEUTRAL)
  THEN
    RESPONSE #100
      Enemy()
  END
  ```
