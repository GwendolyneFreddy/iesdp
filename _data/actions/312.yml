  This action instructs all creatures in the current area(?) ignore the following states flags for the time specified, or until a save-game reload. The creatures still have the state flags set. This action mainly seems to be used to get player characters to look like they are "paying attention" to anything that is happening around them.
  The following states are overridden:

  * state\_sleeping
  * state\_panic
  * state\_stunned
  * state\_helpless
  * state\_confused

  The following states are not overridden:

  * state\_invisible
  * state\_frozen\_death
  * state\_stone\_death
  * state\_dead
  * state\_silence
  * state\_charmed
  * state\_improved invisibility
  * state\_mirror\_image

  Other states are untested.
