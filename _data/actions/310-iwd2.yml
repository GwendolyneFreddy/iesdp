  This action sets the specified teambit to the specified value. Each area has up to 32 global variables (Team\_0, Team\_1 etc). Actors are assigned to groups represented by these variables by this action. The group variables can then be used as a form of communication - when one member of a team sees an enemy, the entire team will converge upon the enemy.
