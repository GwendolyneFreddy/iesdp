  This action instructs the active creature to attack the specified target for one round.

  ```
  IF
    See(NearestEnemyOf())
  THEN
    RESPONSE #100
      AttackOneRound(NearestEnemyOf())
  END
  ```
  {% capture note %} This action shares most of its code with [AttackReevaluate()](#134). In fact, it is 'AttackReevaluate()' with an extra hardcoded bit that forces it to terminate after one round. This means that, unlike in 'AttackReevaluate()', [ActionListEmpty()](../triggers/bgeetriggers.htm#0x402B) will return TRUE once a round is up - and unless you immediately reinstate 'AttackOneRound()', the creature won't continue attacking. {% endcapture %} {% include note.html %}
