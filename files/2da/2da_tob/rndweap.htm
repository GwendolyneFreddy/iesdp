<br />
This file defines what items are generated when a creature uses an item of filename RNDWEPx#.ITM, where x=any character (even letters and symbols, and has no bearing on how RNDMAGIC.2DA is read), and #=the row number of RNDWEP.2DA to use (can be 1-9).  RNDWEPx#.ITM is replaced by the generated item.  Therefore, this works like a random treasure table.<br />
<br />
The first column of RNDWEP.2DA specifies the name of the row, currently a simple generic name.  The rest of the 20 columns have headers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 18, 19, 20.  The column used is specified by a roll of 2D10.  Note that this is different from RNDTREAS.2DA and RNDMAGIC.2DA, which do not have the column labelled '1', but similar to RNDSCROL.2DA and RNDEQUIP.2DA.  Only 21 columns in total are supported, else the 2da file will fail to work entirely.  When this happens, all RNDWEPx#.ITMs are replaced by erroneous invisible items that cannot be removed.<br />
<br />
The BG2:ToB version of RNDWEP.2DA is shown below.  In essence, RNDWEP.2DA works exactly the same as RNDEQUIP.2DA, so see RNDEQUIP.2DA for an example of how RNDWEP.2DA works.  However, RNDWEP.2DA can be directly referenced by RNDEQUIP.2DA, RNDTREAS.2DA or RNDMAGIC.2DA without actually having RNDWEPx#.ITM as a resource.  For example, an entry in RNDMAGIC.2DA that reads RNDWEP03, and a 2D10 roll of 3 will replace RNDWEPx#.ITM with CHAN05.<br />

In BG2:ToB we have:<br />

RNDWEP.2DA supports 9 functional rows of random treasure.  Rows 10 and above are completely ignored.  If RNDWEPx#.ITM references a non-existant or an ignored row number (or if #=0 under any circumstances), then RNDWEPx#.ITM is replaced by an erroneous invisible item that cannot be removed.  Note that the replacing item is NOT RNDWEPx#.ITM itself, in this case. This blank item can likely be altered by setting the default 2da entry to a valid item.<br />
<br />
Items that can be referenced:<br />
<ul>
<li>specific items (for stackable items, a *# suffix, that is, an asterisk followed by a number, can be added to the item ResRef to specify the amount of that item to create, e.g. BOLT04*4 generates a single stack of 4 BOLT04 items; for non-stackable items, a *# suffix does nothing; the limitations on the size of # are the same as that for gold pieces described below)</li>
<li>#, that is, a number, refers to a gold value (e.g. #=016 replaces RNDWEPx#.ITM with a stack of 16 gold).  The maximum stack of gold allowable is 256 pieces.  More than that listed will max out at 231 (interestingly, this is the remainder when you divide 256 into 999; # need not be three digits, so if #=4 or #=04 or #-004, a stack of 4 gold will still be generated without error)-*, that is, a single asterisk, generates an erroneous item, i.e. an invisible item that cannot be removed.  This is useful if you want your creature not to drop anything, but you do not want to use this for containers and item piles</li>
<li>RNDSCR##, which references RNDSCROL.2DA, where ##=row number to use, allowing further randomisation; 2D10 are rolled to determine which column of this file to use</li>
</ul>
<br />
Items that cannot be referenced:<br />
<ul>
<li>RNDEQU##; using this will create RNDEQU##.ITM, exactly as it is (circular loops are not possible)</li>
<li>RNDMAG##; using this will create an erroneous item that cannot be removed</li>
<li>RNDTRE##; using this will create RNDTRE##.ITM, exactly as it is (circular loops are not possible)</li>
<li>RNDWEP##; using this will create RNDWEP##.ITM, exactly as it is (circular loops are not possible)</li>
</ul>
<br />
Since RNDWEP.2DA can reference RNDSCROL.2DA but not RNDMAGIC.2DA nor RNDTREAS.2DA nor RNDEQUIP.2DA, this 2da file is the fourth to the top of the random treasure table hierarchy.<br />
