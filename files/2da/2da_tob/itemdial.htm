    <div class="title_main"> itemdial.2da</div>

<br />
It links a .DLG file to a specific .ITM file to enable it to be conversable. Such as Lilarcor.<br />
In BG2 ToB we have:<br />

<pre>2DA V1.0
*
              LABEL  FILE               
SW2H14        5689   SW2H14
</pre>

The first column is the Item reference (the above example is Lilarcor obviously).<br />
<br />
LABEL column is a reference to the Dialog.Tlk, this will be shown in the item description. 5689 is commonly used for writing &quot;Conversable&quot; on the button.<br />
<br />
FILE is a reference to the name of the DLG file that is started when you click on the Item's Conversable Button.<br />
