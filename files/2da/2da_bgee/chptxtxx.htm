This file defines how to show chapter introduction text.<br />
First name (in our example ch05aund ) determines <a href="../../../file_formats/ie_formats/mos_v2.htm">MOS</a> reference for chapter screen.<br />
The first column is filled by race names. Not all tables include rows for races or classes.<br />
Later there are two columns that could be filled by strrefs from Dialog.tlk.<br />

In BG2EE we have (chptxt6.2da):<br />
