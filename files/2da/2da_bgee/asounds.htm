<br />
Each animation sound 2da contains soundset information associated with each animation with the same 4-letter animation code (see <a href="../2da_bgee/animsnd.htm">ANIMSND.2DA</a>). Rows are paired and are associated with an animation sequences (see <a href="../../ids/bgee/seq.htm">SEQ.IDS</a>). The first row of each pair contains space-delimited sound resource references. When the animation sequence is played, one of the listed sounds are chosen at random. This is ignored if the sound name is identical to the default value (i.e. ***). The second row of each pair contains the frame number of the animation cycle (see relevant BAM files) to play the chosen sound.<br />
<br />
All the SEQ.IDS-related rows are always played unless the creature is STATE_SILENCED. The rows Battle_Cry and Selection are used only if there are no available battle cry and selection sounds present within the <a href="../../../file_formats/ie_formats/cre_v1.htm">CRE</a> file, respectively.<br />
<br />
For example, the file AIRELE1.CRE animation type is CGAMEANIMATIONTYPE_ELEMENTAL_AIR, coded as MAIR. It therefore uses MAIR.2DA for its animation soundset. The ATTACK row pair has three sounds: airel01, nosound, and nosound, played at frames 2, 0, and 0 respectively. When this creature attacks, one sound from this list is chosen from random and played. Note "nosound" is an invalid sound, so no sound plays at all. AIRELE1.CRE will use the Battle_Cry and Selection sounds in MAIR.2DA, because it has no valid battle cry and selection sounds present in the CRE file.<br />

Note. BG2: Throne of Bhaal has a bug where only the first and last sounds will play if there are more than 2 sounds listed under a row. The middle sounds will not play correctly. For example, MSOL.2DA has the following ATTACK row pair, and solarg02 will never play when a creature of animation CGAMEANIMATIONTYPE_SOLAR (MSOL) attacks.<br />
