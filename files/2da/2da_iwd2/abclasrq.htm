This file defines minimum stats (Str,Dex etc.) per class/kit.
The first row (titles of columns ) is filled by the names of defined characteristics of PC (like MIN_STR = minimal strength ).
The first column is filled by class/kits names.
The crossings of the certain identifiers indicate if class/kit could be used with the characteristic of PC - used for character creation.<br />
In IWD2 we have:<br />
