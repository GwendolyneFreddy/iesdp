This file defines constitution influence on the creature.<br />
First column is the value of NPCs constitution<br />
2nd column is the HP bonus for all classes except warriors<br />
3rd the same as above for warriors<br />
4th It refers to the minimum possible roll for Hit Points before 
the bonus is applied. For all human or related characters, this is a 1
(core-rules), but for giants, dragons, etc, it could be as high as 4, as
the chart shows. Normal and Easy difficulties ignore this Min_Roll column
as they grant the maximum possible roll for the class involved, plus any
bonus.<br />
In other words, if I'm a human fighter with an 18 CON, I can roll any value
from 1 (Min_Roll) to 10 and then add my bonus. But if I'm a dragon with 25
CON, I can roll any value from 4 (Min_Roll) to whatever a dragon's max roll
is and then any bonus that may be available. With Easy and Normal
difficulties, the fighter would always roll a 10 + bonus, ignoring the
Min_Roll value.<br />
5th as name states, the rate of regeneration modifier<br />
6th fatigue bonus for constitution<br />
In IWD2 we have:<br />
