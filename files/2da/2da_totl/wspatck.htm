The numbers there are for extra attacks depending on level. A 1 means +1 attack, a -1 means +1/2 attack (weird use of negative numbers). So it is why it goes weirdly from 0 to -1 to 1 to -2.<br />
The original file by the way just goes up to -2 which is somehow wrong with AD&amp;D rules I was told (hence the level 50 patch to rules that gets this modifier up to -3 which is 2.5 extra attacks). I'm actually wondering where this file comes from though since it has weird jumps from -2 to -3 without going through 2...<br />
In IWD TotL we have:<br />
