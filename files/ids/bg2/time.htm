    <div class="title_main"> BG2: ToB Identifiers </div>
<br />
Correlates a general time of day, to a specific hour. Used by the 
<a href="../../bg2triggers.htm"> Time(I:Time*Time) </a> trigger. 
As can be seen from the file, midnight is defined as 0, and time builds 
from there, wrapping from 23 back to 0.<br />
The file is extensible, and new entries can be added for example, adding
<span class="code">4 MYTIME</span> will allow MYTIME to be used in scripts,
giving the time 3am.<br />
